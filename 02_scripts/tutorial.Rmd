# Welcome!

Welcome to the Ellerbe Creek Cleanup Tutorial! To download this file and follow along, head over to our [GitHub page](https://github.com/margaret-swift/ellerbe-creek)

# SECTION 01: WORKFLOW

### Set up your environment

First, you need to set up your environment. This involves installing and loading any libraries that you need to run the code for this module. To run a block of code, click the green arrow in the top right of the gray box below. 

```{r load libraries}

pacman::p_load(tidyverse)

```

### Load your data

Now that you've loaded all the libraries we need, the next step is to load any data for this project. Replace the below code with the location of the dataset in your own file structure.

```{r load data}

# data.dir <- "~/your/data/directory/here/" #change this to match the folder where the data is stored
data.dir <- "../01_data"

file.name <- "durham_data_tutorial_version.csv"
file <- file.path(data.dir, file.name)
data <- read.csv(file)

```




# SECTION 02: Why R?






# SECTION 03: Cleaning Up


### Open the data and take a look

Now, back to the dataset at hand. Did you know that you can view data in R just like you do in Excel? Using the View() command, you can view the dataset like a spreadsheet. Try it out:

```{r view data, eval=FALSE}

View(data)

```

```{r head data}

head(data)

```

Wait a minute, that's not right. What's going on? Sometimes, inappropriate metadata is stored within a .csv file. CSV, or comma-separated values, should only have data in them. If you open this spreadsheet in Excel, you will see that there is a set of data on top of the original that gives valuable metadata on the collection. We want to preserve this data, as it is important, but in a more appropriate way. An easy way to do this is to read the data in three parts. Once, to grab the metadata; second, to grab the column headers; third, to grab the actual data:

```{r fix metadata}

# load the metadata separately using "readLines"
meta <- readLines( file, n=10 ) #metadata stops on row 10
meta <- paste( gsub(',', '', meta), collapse="\n") #format better for viewing by removing errant commas
message(meta)

# now load the data
data <- read.csv(file, skip=12, row.names=NULL) #data is on row 12+
head(data)
```

Now we have the data we need saved in 'data', and the metadata stored in 'meta'. Let's save the metadata into a new file (NOT overwriting the raw data).

```{r save metadata}

file.name <- 'metadata.txt'
file <- file.path(data.dir, file.name)
write.table(meta, file=file, row.names=FALSE, col.names=FALSE)

```


For data cleaning, we're going to cover three main issues: (1) Inconsistent Data Entry, (2) Duplicate Rows, and (3) Missing Data.


### INCONSISTENT DATA ENTRY

Now we are ready to look at the real data! It can be helpful at first to look at the "unique" data values for each column, to get a sense of what you're working with. Let's start with "Sky.Condition"

```{r explore data with multiple spellings}

sort( unique( data$Sky.Condition ) )

```

Ah, it looks like somebody had some inconsistancies with spellings. 

```{r}

# First, make everything in the column lowercase 'tolower()' to make your life easier

data <- data %>%
  mutate(Sky.Condition = tolower( Sky.Condition ))

sort( unique( data$Sky.Condition ) )

data <- data %>%
  mutate(Sky.Condition = tolower( Sky.Condition ))

```



### DUPLICATE DATA
 
```{r find duplicates}

# find rows with "duplicate" in the comments, then create a new data frame just with those.
inx.dup <- which( grepl( 'duplicate', tolower(data$Comments) ) ) 
dupes <- data[inx.dup,] 
head( dupes )

```

Normally, you could just get rid of duplicates using the function distinct(). distinct() simply drops the second row that is duplicated, however. Take a look at some of these values in 'dupes' -- they're not the same! When looking at your own data, you need to make decisions on how to deal with duplicate data. For now, we've decided to take the average of the two values. If you want to use just the first value, distinct() is fine; otherwise, here's how to replace duplicate values with the averages:

```{r}

# Create an ID row to sort on station name, filtered, parameter, and date
dupes <- dupes %>% 
  mutate(ID = paste0(Station.Name, Filtered, Parameter, Date.Time)) %>%
  arrange(ID)

# grab the mean values for each combination
means <- dupes %>% 
  group_by(ID) %>% #group dataframe by ID
  summarize(MeanValue = mean(Value, na.rm=TRUE)) #take the mean and ignore NAs

# collapse the duplicate data frame based on ID and sort it the same way
dupes <- dupes %>% 
  distinct(Station.Name, Filtered, Parameter, Date.Time, .keep_all=TRUE)

# make sure both datasets are the same length and in the same order
nrow(dupes) == nrow(means) && all(dupes$ID == means$ID)

# Now that we're sure, replace Value column of distinct dupes with mean values 
# and remove the ID column
dupes$Value <- means$MeanValue
dupes <- dupes %>% dplyr::select(-ID)

# Put it all together! First, remove duplicated rows from the main data frame
data <- data[-inx.dup,]

# Add the averaged, previously-duplicated rows to the end of the data frame
data <- bind_rows(data, dupes) %>%
  arrange(Station.Name, Filtered, Parameter, Date.Time) #sort data again

head(data)
```



### MISSING DATA

```{r}
summary( data$Value )
any( is.na(data$Value) )

```









# SECTION 04: Visualization and Analysis

Now let's visualize some of this data! Through visualizations, we can take complex or large datasets and simplify them to look for trends. That in turn can help guide our analysis or direct us towards interesting and new questions. 

### Time Series Plots and Analysis
Starting with the basics, we can think about this dataset as a time series and plot a given analyte against time. 

```{r}
# Let's see how concentrations of X changes over time. We can color the points based on the site where the sample was taken.

# JB TO INSERT CODE

# Cool, we can see how the concentration varies overtime, but it's hard to tell how variation throughout the year differs between sites. So let's look at a boxplot of this data! 

# JB TO INSERT CODE 

# Let's get fancy and separate this out by year. Maybe there's a difference between years? 

# JB TO INSERT CODE

# Try doing the same visualizations now, but with a different variable. Make sure you use the exact name of the variable as it is found in the dataset!


```

### Exploring What Drives Variation Between Sites

Why, you might ask, is there variation between the sites? What might be causing that? Let's explore that further with a new dataset! This is a great opportunity to practice loading in the dataset and then doing a few new visualizations. We made it easier on you by cleaning up the dataset, but still check it out to make sure there aren't any quirks that will harm your work.

A note about this dataset: This second dataset is a sampling blitz of ~34 sites in the same stream, conducted seasonally at 3 different points. There are strengths (and weaknesses) to each dataset. Durham's dataset gives us many years (weekly to monthly samples) but only at a few sites. Whereas the Synoptic dataset gives us many sites (~34!) but only at 3 points in time (different seasons).

``` {r}
# Load in the Synoptic dataset here 

# Check it out, see if there's any weird quirks that need to be cleaned

```

Okay lets try some simple, but cool, statistics. There are two ions that were measured in this dataset that might be familiar: Na and Cl. That's table salt! Turns out it is also what we put on our roads in the winter to de-ice. That said, perhaps the concentrations of both maybe are closely coorelated since they come from the same source? Let's find out! 

```{r}
# Let's calculate the coorelation between Na and Cl. The closer to 1, the higher the coorelation. 0 is no coorelation.

# JB TO INSERT CODE

# Now let's visualize it! Is it well coorelated across values? Maybe it is closely coorelated for smaller values vs. large values; or maybe it doesn't matter the concentration. Let's find out.

# JB TO INSERT CODE 

```

Now explore it for yourself for other compounds! 

While you are at it, you could also start to explore some other measures taken alongside this dataset. You'll see all the lovely chemistry data, but there is also socioeconomic data. Is there a coorelation between the density of roads and Na & Cl (since that's probably the main source of these salts)? What other hypotheses do you have? Check out this site for some ideas :D (INSERT LINK TO DATA+ SITE, PARAMATER PAGE).

```{r}
# Try doing the same visualizations now, but with different variables. Make sure you use the exact name of the variable as it is found in the dataset!


```
